##### Assignment: Pair programming project
This is an exercise in pair programming + rapid prototyping. Come up with ideas for a site or web app to be built using **JQuery**. With your partner take notes of your planning stage (a Zoom whiteboard png is sufficient) - including a wireframe, design plan and specific JQ functions you want to implement - you will be responsible for showing this plan when the site is complete. You will have Tuesday in class to work in breakout rooms and you'll present + critique each project in class Thursday April 15.
