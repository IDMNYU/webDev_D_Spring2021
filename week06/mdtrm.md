#### Midterm Project
Think of a topic or issue to create a website for. Perhaps it is something you have researched + written on in the past that you want to re present in multimedia interactive form. Perhaps it is related to an organization you are affiliated with in or outside of school. Perhaps you want to create your own a NET.ART piece. Try to think outside the box - there are millions of websites - what makes this project unique?
